# herd

Find Your Herd is a platform for college students to find other students to walk with from place to place during times when they feel uncomfortable or unsafe to walk alone. By helping students find friends to schedule walks with, we hope to help students feel safer while walking to and from places in the Hyde Park region, especially after sundown.
